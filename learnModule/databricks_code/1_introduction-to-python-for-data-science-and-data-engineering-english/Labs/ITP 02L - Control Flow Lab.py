# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## ![Spark Logo Tiny](https://files.training.databricks.com/images/105/logo_spark_tiny.png) In this lab you:<br>
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Apply basic control flow concepts in Python we learned last lesson, including:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * **`if`** and **`elif`** statements
# MAGIC * More boolean operators
# MAGIC * Type checking

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ### Food Recommender
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For this lab, write the control flow logic for the following food recommender. Users provide the following input:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC *  **`temperature`**: A float representing the temperature outside (in Fahrenheit)
# MAGIC *  **`sunny`**: A boolean set to **`True`** if it is sunny outside, **`False`** otherwise. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Write the system to print the following recommendations:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * If it is at least 60 degrees outside AND it is sunny, recommend `ice cream`.
# MAGIC * If it is at least 60 degrees outside, but it is not sunny, recommend `dumplings`.
# MAGIC * If if it is less than 60 degrees, regardless of the weather, recommend `hot tea`.

# COMMAND ----------

# TODO
temperature = TODO
sunny = TODO

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md <i18n value="7f61fbe1-880d-450f-b1df-26c7450378cc"/>
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Try changing the values of **`temperature`** and **`sunny`** and make sure it recommends the proper foods!

# MAGIC ## Bonus Exercise 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For this part of the lab, write the control flow logic for car maintenance. Users provide the following input:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC *  **`km_since_last_change`**: An integer representing the number of kilometers since the last oil change
# MAGIC *  **`oil_change_light`**: A boolean set to **`True`** if the oil change light is on, **`False`** otherwise. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Write the system to print the following recommendations:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * If it is at least 15000 kilometers since last oil change AND the light is on, recommend `oil change`.
# MAGIC * If it is at least 15000 kilometers since last oil change AND the light is off, recommend `wait`.
# MAGIC * If it is less than 15000 kilometers since last oil change regardless of the light, recommend `wait`.

# COMMAND ----------

# TODO
km_since_last_change = TODO
oil_change_light = TODO

# MAGIC ### Bonus Exercise
# MAGIC
# MAGIC A year is considered a leap year if it.
# MAGIC - Is evenly divisible by 4 AND ...
# MAGIC   - Is either evenly divisible by 400 (e.g. 2000 was a leap year) OR not evenly divisible by 100 (e.g. 2100 will not be a leap year).
# MAGIC - How do you know if a number is evenly divisible by another number?
# MAGIC   - Modulo division
# MAGIC     - 2000 % 4 == 0: True
# MAGIC     - 1901 % 4 == 0: False
# MAGIC   
# MAGIC Write code to implement the logic described above.
# MAGIC - Name the independent variable __year__.
# MAGIC - Name the dependent variable named __is_leap_year__.
# MAGIC - Test the code for the following years:
# MAGIC   - 1900
# MAGIC   - 1901
# MAGIC   - 1904
# MAGIC   - 2000
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Hint**: The nested indentation in the instruction suggests that nested logic may be appropriate here.

# COMMAND ----------

# TODO
year = TODO
is_leap_year = TODO

# COMMAND ----------

dbutils.widgets.text("year", "2022", "Enter Year Here")

# COMMAND ----------

# Check your work

    assert year == 1900 and is_leap_year == False, "Error: 1900 was not a leap year"
elif year == 1901:
    assert year == 1901 and is_leap_year == False, "Error: 1901 was not a leap year"
elif year == 1904:
    assert year == 1904 and is_leap_year == True, "Error: 1904 was a leap year"
elif year == 2000:
    assert year == 2000 and is_leap_year == True, "Error: 2000 was a leap year"

# COMMAND ----------
