# MAGIC #### Problem 1: Even vs. Odd
# MAGIC
# MAGIC One integer operator that's very useful we have not yet seen is [modulo](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp), which uses the symbol **`%`**. Modulo returns the remainder of the division of two integers.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For example, **`12 % 7`** is **`5`**, because 12 divided by 7 is 1 with remainder 5. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Using modulo, write a function called **`even_or_odd(num)`** that accepts an integer **`num`** and will return **`even`** if it is even, **`odd`** otherwise. Remember, all even numbers will have modulo 0 because they are divisible by 2.  
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Hint:** Make sure to use **`return`** rather than **`print`** in the function, so it passes the test cases below.

# MAGIC #### Problem 2: Fizz Buzz
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now that you've built the basic foundations of identifying even vs odd numbers, you're ready to extend that idea to tackle one of the most common programming interview questions: Fizz Buzz.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Write a function  called **`fizz_buzz`** that takes in an integer and performs the following:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * If the input is not an integer at all (remember we can pass in the wrong type, even when we shouldn't), return **`"Wrong type"`**
# MAGIC * For a given integer input, if it is divisible by 5 but not 3 return **`"Fizz"`**.
# MAGIC * If it is divisible by 3 but not 5 return **`"Buzz"`**.
# MAGIC * If it is divisible by both 3 and 5 return **`"FizzBuzz"`**.
# MAGIC * If it is divisible by neither 3 nor 5, return the number itself.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Hint:** You will want to use an **`elif`** statement and **`%`**. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Be careful the order in which you check for each of these conditions. For example, you should check if the input is integer before you check if it is divisible by something.

# MAGIC ### Bonus Exercise
# MAGIC
# MAGIC A year is considered a leap year if it.
# MAGIC - Is evenly divisible by 4 AND ...
# MAGIC   - Is either evenly divisible by 400 (e.g. 2000 was a leap year) OR not evenly divisible by 100 (e.g. 2100 will not be a leap year).
# MAGIC - How do you know if a number is evenly divisible by another number?
# MAGIC   - Modulo division
# MAGIC     - 2000 % 4 == 0: True
# MAGIC     - 1901 % 4 == 0: False
# MAGIC   
# MAGIC Write code to implement the logic described above as a function.
# MAGIC - Name the function __is_leap_year__.
# MAGIC - Define the function to receive a single parameter named __year__.
# MAGIC - Define the function to return a boolean value:
# MAGIC   - True if the value of the parameter __year__ is a leap year.
# MAGIC   - False if the value of the parameter __year__ is a not leap year.
# MAGIC - Test the code for the following years:
# MAGIC   - 1900
# MAGIC   - 1901
# MAGIC   - 1904
# MAGIC   - 2000
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Hint**: The nested indentation in the instruction suggests that nested logic may be appropriate here.

# COMMAND ----------

# COMMAND ----------

assert is_leap_year(1900) == False, "1900 was a leap year"

assert is_leap_year(2000) == True, "2000 was a leap year"
